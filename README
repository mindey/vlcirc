Usage:
python vlcirc.py /path/to/video/file irc_channel

Example: (Linux and MacOS)

1) Execute command:
   python vlcirc.py /home/mindey/AlienPlanet.avi MindeyXX1
2) Open website:
   http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=MindeyXX1
3) Once all of your friends had come to channel, typing:
   play time=180

Will start VLC player on all of the friends' computers almost simultaneously.

For convenience, you may consider adding some thing like:
       alias vlci='python /home/mi/vlcirc.py $*'
to your ~/.bashrc


Example: (Windows)

cp vlcirc.py C:\Python27\
cp AlienPlanet.avi C:\Python27\
cd C:\Python27\
python.exe vlcirc.py AlienPlanet.avi MindeyXX1

P.S. I found that libvlc library, although convenient,
but not readily available on various systems.

I had tried evdev - a keylogger approach, which allows
one to avoid typing commands in IRC, but it requires admin rights.

Wishing to make it immediately usable on more different platforms,
I refrained from using these approaches.

To-Do: If computer clocks are in sync, the synchronization could
be improved by sending exact time, like +1 sec., to avoid error
due to the different ping times. Do it.
